                    I will create a portable robot that can navigate itself through a maze. The inside of the robot would contain a camera that  completes certain steps if it is able to recognize the image on the wall of the maze correctly. 
I hope to 3D print this robot, so I incorporated wholes and a place for screws. Moreover, I hope to 3D design a tire. There were a bunch of tutorials online that helped me design the shape for the robot body, the tire, and the maze. 
<br>
<br>
Moreover, I wanted students to be able to program the robot by pressing certain buttons. Also, students can use Scratch to train a model that will help the robot turn different directions. Scratch is a great language for those who are starting to learn code. As a result, when the student programs the robot, they can see the corresponding Scratch code for each of their commands.  I plan on using a Raspberry pie throughout this project because I would like to display the code blocks and create a live camera feed on the robot.

I decided to use Fusion 360 to prototype my final project. Challenges: It took me a couple of days to get used to using Fusion 360 because it wasn’t similar to any of the prior softwares that I used. One aspect of Fusion 360 that I enjoyed is that you can add different components to all side of an object by clicking the side that you’re interested. Moreover, it took me a while to realize that I had to right click on a object, if I wanted to manipulate it. I enjoyed learning how to insert screws and holes into an object as well. Overall, I still have a lot to learn about Fusion 360, but I’m beginning to understand the logic that I need to have to start creating more complex structures on Fusion 360. 
Also, I experimented with drawing the walls for the maze on Fusion 360. Moreover, I used a press-fit joint for the maze. Moreover, I decided to use a joint called “finger” to insert the walls into the maze.
